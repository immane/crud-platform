# CRUD Platform

CRUD Platform evolves the `crud-skeleton` Symfony backend into a
multi-application microservice platform.

## Current Status

The codebase is currently a **modular monolith** with Store extracted into
`apps/store` as an independently bootable application:

- One Symfony Kernel for the monolith; Store has its own `App\Store\Kernel`.
- One Composer project, service container, database, migration chain,
  Messenger queue, worker, scheduler, and Docker image for the monolith.
- Store has its own config, database (MySQL 8.4), migration baseline, and
  FrankenPHP container.
- Domain modules include Identity, CMS, Commerce, Store, Inventory, Payment, Wallet,
  Promotion, WeChat adapters, and Storage adapters.
- The `Trade -> Store -> Inventory` Outbox/Inbox flow is the strongest existing
  extraction seam.
- Store source lives exclusively in `apps/store/src` with de-prefixed entities
  (`Membership`, `InboxMessage`, `OutboxMessage`, `TradeOrderCancellation`).
- Trade resolves `X-Store-Code` through a local `trade_store_directory` projection
  fed by the `store.directory.upserted.v1` event.

This is not yet a set of independently deployed services. Store cutover (Gateway
routing, standalone worker/scheduler) is deferred until remaining modules are
extracted.

## Target

The target is a monorepo with independently deployable Symfony applications. Each
service owns its Kernel, configuration, database and migrations, queue, worker,
scheduler, image, tests, and CI.

The first extraction candidates are Store and Inventory. Inventory remains disabled
by default and is not production-ready until its safety checklist is complete.

Read the [Microservice Transition Contract](design/microservice-transition.md) for
the target directory structure, service-boundary rules, event envelope, and
extraction gates.

## Local Run

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec app php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
docker compose exec store-app php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
docker compose exec app php bin/console app:identity:user:create admin@example.com admin 'P@ssw0rd' --admin
```

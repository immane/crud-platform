# CRUD Skeleton - Full Codebase Context

> Context snapshot. Last updated: 2026-07-30

---

## 1. Project Overview

**CRUD Skeleton** is a Symfony 8.1 API backend skeleton with:
- **PHP 8.4+**, Doctrine ORM 3.6, MySQL 8 (Docker), SQLite (tests)
- JWT authentication (RS256), OTP/SMS login, WeChat Mini Program / Official Account login
- Expression-based dynamic query engine (`@filter`, `@sort`, `@dql`)
- Modular architecture: **Core** (framework), **Common** (CMS), **Promotion** (DSL-driven promotions), **Identity** (auth), **Trade** (commercial orders), **Store** (multi-store operations), **Payment** (invoices), **Wallet** (balances), **Inventory** (stock & reservation), **Wechat** (login + pay), **Storage** (file upload drivers)
- EasyWeChat 6.x integration (Mini Program, Official Account OAuth, WeChat Pay V3)
- NelmioApiDoc (Swagger at `/api/doc`), PHPUnit 12.5, Docker Compose (12 services: app, worker, scheduler, Store/Inventory/Payment/Wallet apps, MySQL x4, Redis, Mailpit — FrankenPHP)
- MkDocs Material + GitHub Pages documentation
- **i18n**: Symfony Translation with en, zh, zh_Hant, ja — all user-facing messages, entity/field names, and status values translated

### 1.1 Architecture Status And Migration Direction

The current codebase is a **modular monolith**, not a collection of independently
deployable microservices. It has one Kernel, Composer project, service container,
database, migration history, Messenger queue, worker, scheduler, Docker image, and
test suite. The `Trade -> Store -> Inventory` Outbox/Inbox flow is the strongest
existing extraction seam; it does not yet make those modules separate services.

The agreed target is a **multi-application monorepo**. Each extracted service will
own its Kernel, configuration, database/migrations, queues, worker, scheduler,
container image, tests, and CI. The first stage is directory and dependency
governance, not a mass code move or database split. See
[`docs/design/microservice-transition.md`](../design/microservice-transition.md).

Current boundary risks that must be removed before extraction include shared
`Identity\Entity\User` Doctrine associations, synchronous Trade/Payment
calls, Payment/Wechat plugin contracts that expose Doctrine and Symfony types,
and PHP-class-based Messenger contracts. Wallet's legacy Identity FK and User ORM
association have been removed; Wallet identity uses `ownerUuid` only. `Core` is provided by
`packages/platform-kernel`, while
Promotion and Storage remain in-process plugins/adapters until scalar service
contracts exist.

### 1.2 Target Monorepo Layout

The future repository layout uses `apps/` for independently deployable business
services, `packages/` for reusable PHP libraries, `contracts/` for published
cross-service schemas, and `infrastructure/` for broker, gateway, local runtime,
and deployment configuration. Do not use `*-service` suffixes under `apps/`.
Services may retain the current pragmatic Symfony structure (`Controller/`,
`Entity/`, `Repository/`, `Service/`, `MessageHandler/`, `Command/`, `DTO/`,
`Exception/`) during extraction; independently deployable boundaries, database
ownership, and contracts matter more than a simultaneous internal DDD rewrite.

`infrastructure/` contains repository-level runtime configuration such as Docker,
RabbitMQ, and gateway settings. Service-specific Doctrine, Messenger, HTTP-client,
and third-party PHP adapters stay inside their owning `apps/*` application.

`apps/store` now exists as a fully extracted, independently runnable Symfony
application with its own `App\Store\Kernel`, Composer lock, config, migrations, tests,
and FrankenPHP Docker image. It owns all Store source code under `apps/store/src/`
with de-prefixed entities (`Membership`, `InboxMessage`, `OutboxMessage`,
`TradeOrderCancellation`). The monolith loads Store through a Composer path package
(`crud-platform/store-app`) solely as a transition host; it will be removed after
Gateway cutover.

### 1.3 Integration Contract Foundation

`packages/integration-contracts` now provides transport-neutral v1 carrier classes
for **ten** Trade/Store/Inventory messages (nine original + `store.directory.upserted.v1`).
Trade maintains a local `trade_store_directory` projection from this event, eliminating
its synchronous Store service dependency for `X-Store-Code` resolution.
manifest, Draft 2020-12 envelope schema, per-message schemas, and fixtures. The
canonical envelope requires `eventId`, unversioned `type`, `version`,
`aggregateType`, `aggregateId`, `occurredAt`, `correlationId`, `causationId`, and
`payload`; the broker topic is `type + ".v" + version`.

Seven messages are Events (past-tense facts); `inventory.reservation.requested`
and `inventory.reservation.release.requested` are Commands. This foundation does
not change queues, routes, or the existing Outbox/Inbox storage model.
`config/packages/messenger.yaml` explicitly retains Symfony's native PHP serializer
because existing `async` and `failed` rows serialize the old `App\*\Message` wrapper
FQCNs. Those wrappers remain until queued legacy messages are drained or migrated.

All nine existing Trade/Store/Inventory consumers now also accept their matching
neutral carrier through explicit Messenger handler methods. Each method adapts the
carrier envelope to the existing legacy wrapper and reuses the original business
logic, transaction boundaries, and Inbox behavior. All nine Publishers now emit
only neutral carriers through the existing native PHP Messenger serializer. Do not
dual-publish: several consumer effects are not universally Inbox-idempotent. Old
wrappers remain compatibility input for historical queue records and as a
topic-level Publisher rollback target.

Every Publisher now emits the full canonical envelope from Outbox data, including
`aggregateType`, `occurredAt`, `correlationId`, and `causationId`. A legacy Outbox
row without a correlation ID falls back to its `eventId` during publication.

Trade, Store, and Inventory Outboxes now have nullable `correlation_id` and
`causation_id` schema columns. New root messages default correlation to their own
`eventId` and retain a null causation ID; APIs and existing Publisher behavior are
unchanged. The migration deliberately does not backfill or make either column
non-null. A later operational command must backfill unpublished legacy rows in
bounded, resumable batches before publisher cutover or constraint tightening.

The Trade -> Store -> Inventory consumer chain now propagates trace metadata when
it writes a derived Outbox event: `correlationId` is inherited and `causationId`
is the input `eventId`. Legacy envelopes without a correlation ID use their own
event ID as a compatibility root. HTTP actions and scheduled jobs still create new
root correlations through the default Outbox behavior.

Store extraction readiness is tracked in
[`docs/design/store-extraction-readiness.md`](../design/store-extraction-readiness.md).
**Store source has been fully moved** to `apps/store/src` (the single owner of
`App\Store\*`). The monolith loads Store through a Composer `crud-platform/store-app`
path package. Store's internal PHP entities were de-prefixed (`StoreMembership` →
`Membership`, `StoreConsumedEvent` → `InboxMessage`, `StoreOutboxMessage` →
`OutboxMessage`, `StoreTradeOrderCancellation` → `TradeOrderCancellation`) while
physical `store_*` table names remain unchanged. Trade's synchronous StoreContext
resolver was replaced by a `trade_store_directory` local projection driven by the
`store.directory.upserted.v1` neutral event (the 10th integration event). Store
directory changes write to Store Outbox via a Doctrine `onFlush` listener. The
Store application boots independently as a FrankenPHP container with its own MySQL
8.4 database, migration baseline, and 19 registered routes.

`apps/payment` now exists as a fully extracted Symfony application with its own
`App\Payment\Kernel`, Composer lock, config, migrations, tests, FrankenPHP Docker
image, route smoke (`401` placeholder auth), and Payment Outbox publisher. It owns
all Payment source under `apps/payment/src/` including `Invoice`, `PayerDirectory`,
`PaymentOutboxMessage`, `MockGateway`, `InvoiceService`, and `PaymentGatewayInterface`.
The monolith loads Payment through `crud-platform/payment-app` path package. Trade
consumes `payment.invoice.{paid,failed,cancelled,refunded}.v1` neutral carriers via an
Inbox handler for durable lifecycle integration. Cutover is deferred: the monolith
remains the production host until all remaining modules are extracted and Gateway
routing is ready.

`apps/trade` now exists as a fully extracted Symfony application with its own
`App\Trade\Kernel`, Composer lock, configuration, migrations, tests, and FrankenPHP
Docker image. It owns both `App\Trade\*` and `App\Promotion\*`; Payment remains a
temporary direct composition dependency while Trade consumes its durable invoice
lifecycle carriers. The monolith loads Trade through `crud-platform/trade-app`.

`apps/wallet` now exists as a fully extracted Symfony application with its own
`App\Wallet\Kernel`, Composer lock, config, migrations, tests, and FrankenPHP
Docker image. It owns all Wallet source under `apps/wallet/src/` — the single
owner of `App\Wallet\*`. Wallet identity uses `ownerUuid` only; the legacy
`user_id` FK and Identity ORM association have been removed. The monolith loads
Wallet through `crud-platform/wallet-app` path package. Trade uses the neutral
`WalletTransferPortInterface` from `packages/integration-contracts` for wallet
transfers. Payment owns the Wallet gateway and adjustment-provider composition
adapters; root `App\Bridge\PaymentWallet\WalletBalanceAdjustmentPort` translates
the Payment scalar port to Wallet persistence. Cutover is deferred: the monolith remains the
production host until all remaining modules are extracted and Gateway routing
is ready.

## 3. Request Lifecycle

1. `public/index.php` → `App\Kernel` (MicroKernelTrait)
2. `config/routes.yaml` imports: `/api/v1` (Common/Trade/Store/Wallet/Payment/Promotion/Wechat App+Manage), `/api/auth` (Identity), `/api/wechat` (Wechat login), `/system` (introspection), `/api/payment/notify` (webhook)
3. `JwtAuthenticator` intercepts all `/api` routes (except public paths listed in security.yaml)
4. Controller action (trait mixin or custom method) → `BaseService` methods → Doctrine EntityManager → DB
5. `RestController::success()` / `warning()` → JSON `{data, code, message, paginator}`

## 4. Authentication Flow

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | PUBLIC | Email/username/phone + password → `{access_token, refresh_token}` |
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | PUBLIC | **Self-registration** (email, username, password, phone?) → tokens |
| `/api/auth/otp/request` | POST | PUBLIC | Request 6-digit OTP via SMS (Alibaba Cloud) |
| `/api/auth/otp/verify` | POST | PUBLIC | Verify OTP → tokens or mark phone verified |
| `/api/auth/token/refresh` | POST | PUBLIC | Rotate refresh token (old revoked, new issued) |
| `/api/auth/logout` | POST | PUBLIC | Revoke access token + optional refresh token |
| `/api/wechat/miniapp/login` | POST | PUBLIC | WeChat Mini Program `js_code` → JWT tokens |
| `/api/wechat/oauth/url` | GET | PUBLIC | Official Account OAuth redirect URL |
| `/api/wechat/oauth/callback` | POST | PUBLIC | OAuth `code` → JWT tokens |
| `/api/wechat/miniapp/phone` | POST | AUTH | Bind WeChat phone number to authenticated user |

### 4.1 User Profile (App)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/app/users/me` | ROLE_USER | Current user profile |
| PUT | `/api/v1/app/users/me` | ROLE_USER | Update email, username, phone, optional password |
| POST | `/api/v1/app/users/change-password` | ROLE_USER | Change password (requires current) |

### 4.2 Profile (App)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/app/profiles` | ROLE_USER | Current user profile (self-service: nickname, avatar, metadata) |
| PUT | `/api/v1/app/profiles` | ROLE_USER | Update nickname, avatar, metadata (level is admin-only) |

Profile is auto-created on User registration via a Doctrine lifecycle listener. Points are delegated to Wallet (currency=POINTS). Formerly named Member.

### 4.3 User Management (Manage)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/api/v1/manage/users/*` | ROLE_ADMIN | Admin user CRUD |
| POST | `/api/v1/manage/users/{id}/change-password` | ROLE_ADMIN | Admin change user password |

### 4.4 Profile Management (Manage)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/api/v1/manage/profiles/*` | ROLE_ADMIN | Admin profile CRUD (including level) |

**UserService** (`App\Identity\Main\Service\UserService`): encapsulates register, verifyPassword, changePassword, adminChangePassword, updateProfile. Auto-hashes passwords in `update()`.

**Token management**: RS256 JWT (7200s TTL), HMAC-SHA256 refresh tokens with rotation + reuse detection.

**Translation**: AuthController, OtpController, LoginController inject `TranslatorInterface` and pass error messages through `trans()`. JwtAuthenticator also translates `onAuthenticationFailure()` messages.

## 5. Dynamic Query System

`BaseServiceReadListTrait::list()` supports:

| Param | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `@filter` | Expression → DQL WHERE | `entity.status == "active"` |
| `@dql` | Raw DQL sub-query | `(entity.price > 100)` |
| `@order` | ORDER BY | `createdAt\|DESC` |
| `@select` | DQL SELECT | `entity.id, entity.name` |
| `@groupBy` | GROUP BY | `entity.category` |
| `@sort` | In-memory sort | `item.getPrice()` |
| `@expands` | Nested expansion | `category,tags` |
| `@display` | Field projection | `complex`, `reduce` |
| `@transform` | Field transformation | `Math.mul(value, 100)` |
| `page`, `limit` | Pagination | `page=1&limit=20` |

**Expression syntax**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`, `matches`, chained attributes, `Math`, `ArrayCommon`, `FilterDateTime` functions. Falls back to in-memory `LegacyEvaluator` when DQL compilation fails.

## 6. BaseService Architecture

`BaseServiceInterface` and `BaseService` use `@template TEntity of object` to propagate entity types through the service layer. Concrete services declare `@extends BaseService<Entity>` and interfaces declare `@extends BaseServiceInterface<Entity>`. This enables PHPStan to infer return types from `get()`, `new()`, and `update()` at call sites.

```
BaseService<Order> (abstract, @template TEntity, @implements BaseServiceInterface<TEntity>)
├── BaseServiceInfrastructureTrait    # EM, Logger, Serializer, Validator, Transactions
├── BaseServiceReadListTrait<TEntity>          # get(mixed): TEntity|null, list(): mixed
└── BaseServiceMutationTrait<TEntity>          # new(): object, update(mixed): object|false, remove(): bool
```

Key PHPDoc contracts:
- **`get(mixed $criteria)`**: Accepts `TEntity|int|string|array<string, mixed>|QueryBuilder` → returns `TEntity|null`
- **`list(array $params)`**: Returns `mixed` (QueryBuilder, Entity[], or scalar arrays depending on @select/@groupBy)
- **`new()`**: Returns `object` (native), `@return TEntity` (PHPDoc)
- **`update(mixed $object, ?array $data)`**: Returns `object|false` — native `mixed` param with PHPDoc `@param mixed` for trait compatibility
- **`remove($object)`**: Accepts `TEntity|int|string|array<string, mixed>`
- **`wrapInTransaction(callable $fn)`**: Transaction with commit/rollback

## 7. Trade Module — Order Lifecycle

### 7.1 State Machine (workflow.yaml)

```
draft → pending → confirmed → paid → fulfilled → completed → refunded
  │
  └→ awaiting_store_acceptance → store_accepted → confirmed
                               └→ store_rejected → cancelled
```

### 7.2 OrderService Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `calculatePrices(items, currency, storeCode?, meta?)` | Pipeline: BasePriceCalculator → QuantityCalculator → **TotalAggregator (subtotal, priority 55)** → **PromotionCalculator (priority 60)**. `meta` is an opaque bidirectional channel for calculators. |
| `createOrder(..., ?StoreContext)` | Creates Order + OrderItems. A resolved StoreContext (from local `trade_store_directory` projection populated by `store.directory.upserted.v1`) writes `_store` metadata and `trade.order.created.v1` in the same transaction. |
| `pay(Order, systemWalletId, paymentMethod)` | User wallet → system wallet via `TransferService`. Sets `paidAt`. |
| `refund(Order, systemWalletId, reason)` | System wallet → user wallet via `TransferService`. Sets `refundedAt`. |
| `fulfill(Order, data)` | Set tracking/shipping + `fulfilledAt`. |

### 7.3 Order Entity Fields

| Field | Type | When Set |
|-------|------|----------|
| `paidAt` | DateTimeImmutable | On `pay` transition |
| `refundedAt` | DateTimeImmutable | On `refund` transition |
| `fulfilledAt` | DateTimeImmutable | On `fulfill` transition |
| `paymentMethod` | string | On pay |
| `trackingNumber` | string | On fulfill |
| `shippingAddress` | text | On fulfill |
| `refundReason` | text | On refund |
| `metadata` | json | Optional request payload from app/manage order creation; useful for receiver/address snapshots |

### 7.4 Manage Order Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/manage/orders` | Create with price calculation |
| **POST** | **`/manage/orders/quote`** | **Price preview without creating order** |
| PUT | `/manage/orders/{id}` | Update draft only |
| DELETE | `/manage/orders/{id}` | Delete draft only |
| GET | `/manage/orders/{id}/items` | View order items |
| POST | `/manage/orders/{id}/pay` | Wallet payment + transition |
| POST | `/manage/orders/{id}/fulfill` | Fulfill with tracking |
| POST | `/manage/orders/{id}/refund` | Wallet refund + transition |
| GET | `/manage/orders/todo` | Orders with pending transitions |
| GET | `/manage/orders/{id}/transitions` | Available transitions |
| POST | `/manage/orders/{id}/do/{transition}` | Execute generic transition |

### 7.5 App Order Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/app/orders` | Create order. With trusted `X-Store-Code`, returns `202` while Store accepts asynchronously; otherwise uses the standard Trade flow. |
| **POST** | **`/app/orders/quote`** | **Price preview without creating order** |
| GET | `/app/orders/{id}/items` | View own order items |
| GET | `/app/orders/{id}/items` | View own order items |
| POST | `/app/orders/{id}/cancel` | Cancel own order (draft/pending/confirmed) |
| POST | `/app/orders/{id}/payment` | **Pay order via gateway (wallet, mock, wechat)** |

### 7.6 App Specification Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/app/specifications` | Browse all active specs |
| GET | `/api/v1/app/specifications/by-product/{id}` | Specs for a product |
| GET | `/api/v1/app/specifications/{id}` | Spec detail |

## 8. Payment Module

### 8.1 Invoice System

```
Invoice (pending→paying→paid→refunded)
  ├── payment: 'wallet'|'wechat'|'mock'
  ├── scene: 'order'|'deposit'|'wallet_topup'
  ├── amount/currency (cents)
  └── payer (User, nullable)
```

### 8.2 PaymentGatewayInterface — Gateway Registry Pattern

```php
interface PaymentGatewayInterface {
    static getName(): string;           // e.g. 'wallet', 'wechat', 'mock'
    pay(Invoice, int $amount, array $options): PaymentResult;
    notify(Request $request): PaymentNotifyResult;
    refund(Invoice, int $amount, int $paidAmount, string $reason, array $options): PaymentRefundResult;
    getNotifySuccessResponse(PaymentNotifyResult $result): Response;
}
```

Gateways receive **explicit payment/refund amounts** and MUST NOT inspect deduction or adjustment options. `Invoice::amount` remains the gross business payable amount; the gateway amount is computed by `InvoiceService` after applying payment adjustments.

Gateways are auto-tagged `payment.gateway` via `_instanceof` rule. `PaymentGatewayRegistry` uses `#[AutowireIterator('payment.gateway')]` for auto-discovery.

### 8.2.1 Payment Adjustment Providers

Payment defines `PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface` — a pre-payment hook that reduces the amount a gateway must process. Implementations live in the owning module (e.g., Wallet provides `WalletBalanceAdjustmentProvider` for wallet balance deduction). Providers are auto-tagged `payment.adjustment_provider` and collected by `PaymentAdjustmentRegistry`.

| Provider | Module | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `wallet_balance` | Wallet | Wallet balance deduction before gateway payment |
| (future) coupons / points | Coupon / Loyalty modules | Other deduction types through the same extension point |

`InvoiceService` orchestrates adjustment providers and gateways without knowing deduction internals:
1. Apply registered adjustments → total applied amount
2. Compute `gatewayAmount = invoice.amount - adjustmentAmount`
3. Call gateway with explicit amount

### 8.2.2 First-Phase Gateways

| Gateway | Module | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `mock` | Payment (`apps/payment/src/Service/Gateway/MockGateway.php`) | Deterministic test/development gateway |
| `wallet` | Payment (`apps/payment/src/Service/Gateway/WalletGateway.php`) | Internal wallet balance payment |
| `wechat` | Payment (`apps/payment/src/Service/Gateway/WechatPayGateway.php`) | WeChat Pay V3 adapter |

### 8.3 Payment Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/app/invoices/{id}/pay/{payment}` | User pays invoice via gateway |
| POST | `/manage/invoices/{id}/pay/{payment}` | Admin pays invoice |
| POST | `/manage/invoices/{id}/cancel` | Cancel invoice |
| POST | `/manage/invoices/{id}/refund` | Refund invoice |
| POST | `/api/payment/notify/{payment}` | Payment callback (public, G/W signature verified) |

### 8.4 Payment/Trade Integration Status

Current payment-result propagation is synchronous: `InvoiceService` dispatches
`InvoicePaidEvent`, `InvoiceFailedEvent`, `InvoiceCancelledEvent`, and
`InvoiceRefundedEvent`; `Trade\EventListener\OrderInvoiceListener` updates the Trade
order in process.

The approved next migration is intentionally limited to **Payment Outbox -> Trade
Inbox**. Payment will write versioned lifecycle events in the same transaction as an
Invoice state mutation, and Trade will consume them idempotently. The first event is
`payment.invoice.paid.v1`, followed by failed/cancelled/refunded events. Trade keeps
the current synchronous `InvoiceService` calls for Invoice creation, payment initiation,
cancellation, and refund during this phase. A Payment Inbox and
`trade.payment.requested.v1` Saga are explicitly deferred until Payment service
extraction requires them.

The future payment Outbox publisher will join the automatic scheduler alongside Trade
and Store publishers; the existing `worker` will consume its Messenger messages.

### 8.5 Wallet App Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/app/wallets` | Current user's wallets only |
| GET | `/app/wallets/{id}` | Current user's wallet detail only |
| GET | `/app/wallets/balance` | Current user's wallet balance audit: `totalBalance`, `totalDeposited`, `discrepancy`, `matches`, `walletCount` |
| GET | `/app/transactions` | Current user's wallet transactions only |
| GET | `/app/transactions/{id}` | Current user's transaction detail only |

Manage keeps global audit endpoints: `GET /manage/wallets/balance` and `POST /manage/wallets/reconcile`.

## 9. Wechat Module

### 9.1 WechatUser Entity (OneToOne → User)

```
WechatUser (wechat_user) ──OnetoOne──> User (users)
  openid (unique), unionid, sessionKey
  nickname, avatar, sex, province, city, country
  appType ('miniapp' | 'official')
  rawData (json)
```

**User.php is NOT modified** — WechatUser extends identity via OneToOne with CASCADE delete.

### 9.2 Login Flow

```
Mini Program: wx.login() → js_code → POST /api/wechat/miniapp/login
  → WechatService.code2Session() → {openid, unionid, session_key}
  → WechatAuthService.authenticateFromMiniApp()
    ├─ findByOpenid(openid) → hit → update sessionKey → return User
    └─ miss → new User() + new WechatUser() → flush → return User
  → TokenManager.createTokens() → {access_token, refresh_token, expires_in}

Official Account: redirect → oauth code → POST /api/wechat/oauth/callback
  → WechatService.getOAuthUser(code) → {openid, nickname, avatar, ...}
  → WechatAuthService.authenticateFromOfficialAccount()
  → TokenManager.createTokens() → JWT
```

New users get random password (cannot password-login), synthetic email/username from openid.

### 9.3 WechatPayGateway

Implements `PaymentGatewayInterface` with `getName() → 'wechat'`:
- **File**: `apps/payment/src/Service/Gateway/WechatPayGateway.php`
- **pay()**: JSAPI (requires payer openid from WechatUser) or Native (QR code) — receives explicit `$amount`
- **notify()**: EasyWeChat server + validator, signature verification
- **refund()**: Creates refund via WeChat Pay V3 API — receives explicit `$paidAmount` for `total`
- Auto-registered as `payment.gateway` via `_instanceof` rule

### 9.4 WechatUser CRUD Controllers

| Prefix | Auth | Filter | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/app/wechat-users` | ROLE_USER | `['user' => $this->getUser()]` | User-scoped CRUD (only own data) |
| `/api/v1/manage/wechat-users` | ROLE_ADMIN | `[]` (no filter) | Admin CRUD (all records) |

When `$this->getUser()` returns null in App controllers, `commonFilter()` returns `['id' => -1]` to block all records (security: unauthenticated users see nothing).

## 10. Internationalization (i18n)

### 10.1 Architecture

Symfony Translation component with 4 locales. Translation files are YAML-based under `translations/`.

| Locale | File | Language |
|--------|------|----------|
| `en` | `translations/messages.en.yaml` | English (default, identity mapping) |
| `zh` | `translations/messages.zh.yaml` | Chinese (Simplified) |
| `zh_Hant` | `translations/messages.zh_Hant.yaml` | Chinese (Traditional) |
| `ja` | `translations/messages.ja.yaml` | Japanese |

**~280 translation keys** per locale covering: entity names (19), field names (96), status/enum values (17), authentication/JWT messages, WeChat errors, Core framework errors (View mixins, Service traits), success messages, Wallet/Trade/Payment/media/Storage errors, expression parser errors, and more.

### 10.2 Translation Flow

All user-facing messages pass through the translator:

| Source | Method | Translation Point |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Uncaught exceptions (API routes) | `ExceptionInterceptor::onKernelException()` | `$this->translator->trans($exception->getMessage())` |
| Controller warnings | `RestController::warning()` | `$this->getTranslator()->trans($error_msg)` |
| Auth/Otp/Login errors | `AuthController::error()` etc. | `$this->translator->trans($message)` |
| JWT auth failures | `JwtAuthenticator::onAuthenticationFailure()` | `$this->translator->trans($messageKey)` |
| Entity field names | `EntityController` `/system/entities/{name}` | `$this->getTranslator()->trans($plainTextFieldName)` |

### 10.3 LocaleListener (`packages/platform-kernel/src/EventListener/LocaleListener.php`)

Registered at `kernel.request` priority 20. Language detection priority:

1. **`?_locale=` query parameter** — explicit override (e.g., `?_locale=ja`)
2. **`Accept-Language` header** — browser-sent preference with quality factor ordering  
   - `zh-CN`, `zh-Hans` → `zh`  
   - `zh-TW`, `zh-HK`, `zh-Hant` → `zh_Hant`  
   - `ja-JP` → `ja`  
   - `en-US`, `en-GB` → `en`
3. **Fallback** — `config/packages/translation.yaml` `default_locale: en`

Sub-requests are ignored.

### 10.4 Multi-language README

| Language | File |
|----------|------|
| English | `README.md` |
| Chinese (Simplified) | `README.zh-cn.md` |
| Chinese (Traditional) | `README.zh-hant.md` |
| Japanese | `README.ja.md` |

## 11. Storage Module

Storage is an infrastructure module under `src/Storage/`. Common/Media depends on
`MediaStorageInterface` and `MediaStorageRegistry`. The Qiniu driver currently reads
`common_setting` through Common repositories, so Storage is not yet independently
deployable; this dependency must be removed before extraction.

### 11.1 Drivers

| Driver | Class | Configuration | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| `local` | `App\Storage\Service\LocalStorage` | `media.local.upload_path`, `media.local.base_url` | Always available. Stores under `public/uploads/{YYYYMM}/{random}.{ext}` and returns `/uploads/...` URLs. |
| `qiniu` | `App\Storage\Service\QiniuStorage` | `common_setting` keys | Optional. Reads `qiniu.access_key`, `qiniu.secret_key`, `qiniu.bucket`, `qiniu.domain` at runtime. |

Qiniu SDK note: `qiniu/php-sdk` is intentionally not required by `composer.json` because v7.14 emits PHP 8.5 vendor deprecations. `QiniuStorage` checks for `Qiniu\Auth`, `Qiniu\Storage\UploadManager`, and `Qiniu\Storage\BucketManager` only when `storage=qiniu` is used; if missing, it throws a clear runtime error. Server deployments that need Qiniu may install it locally with `composer require qiniu/php-sdk`.

### 11.2 Media Upload Flow

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/app/media/upload` | POST multipart | ROLE_USER | Upload current user's media. App media list/detail is scoped by `['user' => $this->getUser()]`. |
| `/api/v1/app/media/{id}` | DELETE | ROLE_USER | Delete current user's own uploaded media. Uses app `commonFilter()` so other users' media returns 404; local files are best-effort removed. |
| `/api/v1/manage/media/upload` | POST multipart | ROLE_ADMIN | Admin upload endpoint, reuses App upload action via inheritance. Manage media CRUD uses no common filter. |
| `/api/v1/public/media` | GET | PUBLIC | Public read-only media list. Only returns media with nullable owner (`user IS NULL`). |
| `/api/v1/public/media/{id}` | GET | PUBLIC | Public read-only media detail. Only returns media with nullable owner (`user IS NULL`). |

Multipart fields:
- `file`: required uploaded file
- `storage`: optional driver name, defaults to `MEDIA_STORAGE_DEFAULT` / `media.storage.default` (`local`)
- `category`: optional `common_category` id; invalid ids return `Category is not found`
- `alt`, `title`, `width`, `height`: optional metadata

`MediaService::createFromUpload()` validates file presence/size/MIME, resolves the selected storage driver, stores the physical file, persists `Common\Entity\Media`, assigns the current authenticated `User` when available, and binds an optional `Category` from multipart `category`. `MediaService::remove()` best-effort deletes the physical file via the media's stored driver before removing the entity. App media delete now reuses `DeleteApiViewMixin`, scoped by owner.

`Media` stores `storage`, nullable owner `user` (`ManyToOne User`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`), and nullable `category` (`ManyToOne Category`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`). Manage media create/update accepts `category` ids. Public media uses a QueryBuilder `commonFilter()` with `media.user IS NULL` because array criteria cannot express SQL `IS NULL`.

## 12. System Introspection Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/system/entities` | GET | List all Doctrine entity FQCNs |
| `/system/entities/{entityName}` | GET | Field + association metadata per entity (type, nullable, targetEntity) |
| `/system/router` | GET | List all registered routes |

Placed in `packages/platform-kernel/src/Controller/System/` (framework layer). NelmioApiDoc path_patterns include `^/system`. Tag: `System`.

## 13. Key Patterns

| Pattern | Where | Detail |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Trait mixins** | View layer | 9 PHP traits composed into controllers |
| **View message constants** | Core/View | `ApiViewMessages` extracts all hardcoded strings from View traits into constants + formatters |
| **Generic services** | Core/Service | `@template TEntity` + `@extends BaseService<Entity>` enables static analysis inference across the service layer |
| **Field whitelisting** | Controllers | `$requiredCreateProperties`, `$acceptedCreateProperties`, `$acceptedUpdateProperties` |
| **Money in cents** | Wallet + Trade + Payment | `bigint` cents, API boundary converts ×/÷100 |
| **UUID v4** | Trade + Wallet | `UUID::v4()` for external identity |
| **Soft delete** | Trade | `isDeleted` boolean on Product, Specification |
| **Snapshot** | Trade | `OrderItem` captures `specSnapshot`/`productSnapshot` at creation |
| **Order metadata** | Trade | App order creation accepts optional `metadata` JSON and persists it as-is to `trade_order.metadata`, useful for receiver/address snapshots and frontend extension data |
| **State machine** | Trade | Symfony Workflow for orders |
| **Token rotation + reuse detection** | Identity | HMAC-SHA256 refresh tokens |
| **Idempotency** | Wallet | `referenceId` unique constraint on WalletTransaction |
| **Pipeline** | Trade | `PriceCalculatorInterface` with priority ordering |
| **Meta channel** | Trade | `PriceCalculationContext.meta` / `PriceCalculationResult.meta` — bidirectional opaque channel. Calculators read/write module-specific keys (`meta['promotion']`, `meta['coupon']`). Trade never inspects content. |
| **Optimistic locking** | Wallet | `#[ORM\Version]` on Wallet |
| **Post-response enrichment** | Core | `OpenApiEnricherListener` post-processes `/api/doc` and `/api/doc.json` |
| **commonFilter** | Controllers | Array criteria or QueryBuilder injected into all queries. `[]` = no filter (admin), `['user' => $user]` = user-scoped, `['id' => -1]` = block all, QueryBuilder required for `IS NULL` filters |
| **Payment via wallet** | Trade | `POST /app/orders/{id}/payment` with `payment: "wallet"` creates Invoice → WalletGateway deducts user wallet |
| **Payment integration migration** | Payment -> Trade | Next phase replaces synchronous Invoice domain-event consumption with Payment Outbox and Trade Inbox; Payment request Inbox/Saga remains deferred |
| **Balance audit** | Wallet | `GET /app/wallets/balance` audits only current user's wallets; `GET /manage/wallets/balance` is global; `POST /manage/wallets/reconcile` fixes per-wallet gaps with `TYPE_ADJUSTMENT` |
| **Idempotent deposit** | Wallet | `POST /transfers/deposit` with `referenceId` — duplicate requests return existing transaction |
| **Gateway registry** | Payment | `#[AutowireIterator]` + `_instanceof` auto-tags all `PaymentGatewayInterface` implementations |
| **Adjustment provider registry** | Payment | `#[AutowireIterator]` + `_instanceof` for `PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface` — wallet deduction is a Wallet-owned provider |
| **Deduction owned by Wallet** | Wallet | Wallet balance deduction lives in Wallet (`WalletPaymentDeduction` entity, `WalletPaymentDeductionService`, `WalletBalanceAdjustmentProvider`). Payment owns only the generic adjustment contract |
| **OneToOne extension** | Wechat | `WechatUser` extends User identity without modifying User entity |
| **Storage driver registry** | Storage | `MediaStorageInterface` implementations are tagged `media.storage`; callers select driver with multipart `storage` field |
| **Media ownership** | Common | App media endpoints are user-scoped via `commonFilter()`, including delete. Manage media endpoints inherit App upload code but override `commonFilter()` to `[]`. Public media endpoints expose only ownerless media (`user IS NULL`) over anonymous GET. |
| **Error response translation** | Identity + Core | AuthController, OtpController, LoginController, JwtAuthenticator inject `TranslatorInterface` — all error() and onAuthenticationFailure() methods pass messages through `trans()` |
| **Locale auto-detection** | Core | `LocaleListener` at kernel.request priority 20: `?_locale=` param > `Accept-Language` header > default_locale fallback. Sub-requests are ignored. |
| **Apache .htaccess** | public/ | Rewrite all non-file requests to `index.php` + forward `Authorization` header via `SetEnvIf` for JWT in PHP-FPM environments |
| **System introspection** | Core | Entity metadata + route export via `/system/*` endpoints |
| **Promotion DSL** | Promotion | Custom lexer/parser/evaluator for human-readable promotion rules |
| **Promotion strategy tag** | Promotion | `promotion.strategy` auto-tag for strategy implementations, collected via `#[AutowireIterator]` |
| **Promotion calculator pipeline** | Promotion | `PromotionCalculator` tagged `trade.price_calculator` (priority 60). TotalAggregator runs at priority 55 to establish the subtotal before promotion evaluation. |
| **Profile auto-creation** | Identity | `Profile` entity created on User registration via Doctrine lifecycle listener; user has `$profile` (OneToOne) instead of `$member` |
| **Points delegated to Wallet** | Identity | Profile points use Wallet with currency=POINTS |
| **Inventory reservation** | Inventory | Store requests reservation by specification; Inventory resolves recipes, reserves material stock atomically, produces confirmed/rejected events |
| **Inventory global bypass** | Store + Inventory | INVENTORY_ENABLED env var allows deployments without inventory management |
| **Per-stock negative inventory** | Inventory | Each InventoryStock has allowNegativeStock flag; independent per store/material pair |
| **Outbox claim pattern** | Inventory + Store + Trade | Outbox publishers atomically claim rows via UPDATE WHERE, preventing concurrent delivery |

## 14. API Documentation System

### 14.1 Architecture

Controller `#[OA\*]` attributes → swagger-php (raw spec) → NelmioApiDocBundle (merge config) → `OpenApiEnricherListener` (post-process) → Swagger UI

### 14.2 OpenApiEnricherListener (`packages/platform-kernel/src/EventListener/OpenApiEnricherListener.php`)

Enriches all endpoints (90+):
- **`detectTag()`**: Infers module tag from `operationId`: `manage-products-*` → Products, `system-*` → System, `wechat-*` → Wechat, `sys-auth-*` → Auth, etc.
- **`META`**: Optional summaries/descriptions for key endpoints
- **`ensureTag()`**: Adds dynamically detected tags to the spec's tag list
- **Generic tag removal**: Filters out operation-type tags (List, Detail, Create, Update, Delete, Workflow) from swagger-php output — replaced with module tags
- Registered in `services.yaml` as `kernel.event_listener` on `kernel.response` (priority -10)

### 14.3 Tag Auto-Detection

| operationId Pattern | Tag |
|---------------------|-----|
| `sys-auth-*` | Auth |
| `system-*` | System |
| `wechat-*` | Wechat |
| `manage-products-*`, `app-products-*` | Products |
| `manage-orders-*`, `app-orders-*` | Orders |
| `manage-categories-*`, `app-categories-*` | Categories |
| `manage-tags-*`, `app-tags-*` | Tags |
| `manage-contents-*`, `app-contents-*` | Contents |
| `manage-comments-*`, `app-comments-*` | Comments |
| `manage-pages-*`, `app-pages-*` | Pages |
| `manage-media-*`, `app-media-*` | Media |
| `manage-settings-*`, `app-settings-*` | Settings |
| `manage-promotions-*`, `app-promotions-*` | Promotions |
| `manage-promotion-templates-*`, `app-promotion-templates-*` | PromotionTemplates |
| `manage-wallets-*`, `manage-transactions-*`, `manage-transfers-*` | Wallet |
| Any other `manage-{X}-*` | {X} (auto-title-cased) |

### 14.4 Schema Configuration (`config/packages/nelmio_api_doc.yaml`)

44+ named schemas across 13 tags (Auth, Products, Orders, Categories, Tags, Contents, Comments, Pages, Media, Settings, Promotions, PromotionTemplates, Wallet, System, Wechat). Each with field-level type, description, enum, and example values. `path_patterns` includes both `^/api` and `^/system`.

## 15. Database Tables (22 monolith + 4 extracted-app baselines)

| Version | Tables |

## 17. Testing

- **Framework**: PHPUnit 12.5
- **DB**: SQLite `var/test.db` in test environment
- **Coverage**: 90% minimum (enforced in CI), currently **90.49% lines** from latest local Xdebug run
- **Test count**: **1772 tests**, **5652 assertions**
- **Architecture gate**: Deptrac enforces that Core has no business-module dependency and blocks new cross-module Entity/Repository dependencies. `deptrac-baseline.yaml` records exact legacy source-to-target debt; run `composer deptrac`.
- **Static analysis**: PHPStan Level 8 with zero errors in its configured scope (`src/`, excluding optional SDK code, exception classes, and documented false-positive suppressions). Generic contract via `@template TEntity` on `BaseServiceInterface`/`BaseService` + `@extends` on 18 concrete service pairs. Rector automates Doctrine Collection/Repository PHPDoc with `composer rector:types`; CI enforces `composer rector:types:check` as a dry-run.
- **Local PHP note**: default `php` may point to PHP 7.4; use Homebrew PHP 8.5 at `/opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.5/bin/php` for local Symfony/PHPUnit commands.
- **HTML coverage report**: `XDEBUG_MODE=coverage ./vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html var/coverage`
- **Key test groups**:
  - `tests/Trade/`: 216+ tests + Controller/Manage/OrderControllerTest (16 tests for not-found, workflow guards, payment validation)
  - `tests/Wallet/`: ~105 tests (Entity, Integration, Transfer Service, WalletService, Payment/Gateway, API regression)
  - `tests/Common/`: 118 tests (Entity, Integration, Batch update, media upload/delete, Picture CRUD)
  - `tests/Identity/`: 116+ tests (Auth, OTP, Token, Black box, UserService, UserController, UserApiIntegration, Profile entity, ProfileController)
   - `tests/Promotion/`: 320+ tests (Entity, DSL lexer/parser/evaluator, Strategies, Engine, Calculator, App/Manage controllers, real SQLite pipeline integration with Doctrine + OrderService)
  - `tests/Payment/`: ~60 tests (Gateway, Registry, Adjustment/Provider, Invoice, Multi-gateway integration)
  - `tests/Wechat/`: 59 tests (Entity, Service, AuthService, Payment/Gateway, Controller, Repository)
  - `tests/Core/`: 70+ tests (BaseService, RestController, Parser, Serializer, LocaleListener, MutationTrait, Utils, System controllers — all PHPStan Level 8 compliant)
   - `tests/Promotion/Integration/`: 8 real SQLite quote pipeline tests (store isolation, global campaigns, member-targeted item discounts, stacking, best-price conflict, Nth-item, multi-SKU, expiry, mixed rules)
   - `tests/Integration/`: ~20 cross-module tests
   - `tests/Store/`: Store entities/services plus Trade -> Store -> Trade integration and Store-scoped HTTP flow
   - `tests/Inventory/`: 23 tests (Entity, Service, Integration, Message, API, Handler)
   - `tests/Store/Integration/`: Store-Inventory integration tests (confirmation, rejection, cancellation before creation, delayed cancellation, duplicate SKU)
   - `scripts/tests/api-smoke.sh`: real HTTP auth/catalog/wallet/order/payment smoke; strict 401/403/404 checks
   - `scripts/tests/store-smoke.sh`: real HTTP Store-scoped order, Trade Outbox, Messenger consumer, Store Outbox, and `store_accepted` assertion

## 18. Environment Variables (Key)

| Var | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `APP_ENV`, `APP_DEBUG` | Symfony environment |
| `DATABASE_URL` | DB connection (PostgreSQL/SQLite/MySQL) |
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` | RS256 key pair (Docker dev: generated once under mounted `./var/jwt` if missing) |
| `JWT_PASSPHRASE` | Private key passphrase |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` | HMAC-SHA256 secret |
| `OTP_REDIS_DSN` | Redis for OTP storage |
| `ALIYUN_SMS_*` | Alibaba Cloud SMS |
| `WECHAT_MINIAPP_APP_ID`, `WECHAT_MINIAPP_SECRET` | WeChat Mini Program |
| `WECHAT_OFFICIAL_APP_ID`, `WECHAT_OFFICIAL_SECRET`, `WECHAT_OFFICIAL_TOKEN`, `WECHAT_OFFICIAL_AES_KEY` | Official Account |
| `WECHAT_PAY_MCH_ID`, `WECHAT_PAY_SECRET_KEY`, `WECHAT_PAY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `WECHAT_PAY_CERTIFICATE`, `WECHAT_PAY_NOTIFY_URL` | WeChat Pay V3 |
| `MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN` | Async transport |
| `OUTBOX_PUBLISH_INTERVAL` | Seconds between automatic Trade/Store Outbox relay runs (default `5`) |
| `DEFAULT_URI` | Base URL for CLI contexts |
| `MAILER_DSN` | Mailer transport |
| `MEDIA_STORAGE_DEFAULT` | Default media storage driver (`local` by default) |
| `INVENTORY_ENABLED` | Toggle global inventory bypass (`0` = disabled, `1` = enabled, default `0`) |

Qiniu configuration is intentionally **not** environment-variable based. Configure these records in `common_setting` when `storage=qiniu` is needed: `qiniu.access_key`, `qiniu.secret_key`, `qiniu.bucket`, `qiniu.domain`.

## 19. Docker Deployment

### 19.1 Architecture

12 services in `compose.yaml`: **app** (FrankenPHP), **worker** (Messenger async consumer, CLI-only), **scheduler** (Trade/Store/Inventory Outbox relay), **store-app**, **inventory-app**, **payment-app**, **wallet-app**, **database** (MySQL 8.4 for monolith), **store-database**, **inventory-database**, **payment-database**, **wallet-database**, **redis** (Redis 7 Alpine), **mailer** (Mailpit).

Store, Inventory, Payment, and Wallet each have a `Dockerfile`, `docker/Caddyfile`, and independent MySQL instance. The monolith runs them through `crud-platform/store-app`, `crud-platform/inventory-app`, `crud-platform/payment-app`, and `crud-platform/wallet-app` Composer path packages. Worker and scheduler override `APP_ENV=prod` (DebugBundle not installed in `--no-dev` image) and disable inherited HTTP ports and healthchecks.

### 19.2 Development (zero-config)

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec app php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
docker compose exec store-app php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
docker compose exec inventory-app php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
docker compose exec payment-app php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
docker compose exec wallet-app php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
docker compose exec app php bin/console app:identity:user:create admin@example.com admin 'P@ssw0rd' --admin
```

- `compose.override.yaml` auto-loads — sets `APP_ENV=dev`, `APP_DEBUG=1`, source mount for app, store-app, inventory-app, payment-app, and wallet-app
- `docker/app/entrypoint.sh` creates development JWT keys once under mounted `./var/jwt` if missing, and creates an empty `.env` placeholder for Symfony Runtime
- Root database port is configurable via `MYSQL_PORT` to avoid host-side MySQL collisions

### 19.3 Production

Requires `.env.prod.local` copied from `.env.prod.example` with `APP_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`. JWT keys are generated on the host at `./var/jwt/` and mounted into the container. Store app requires its own `STORE_APP_SECRET`, `STORE_MYSQL_USER`, `STORE_MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and `STORE_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`. Start production with `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.prod.yaml --env-file .env.prod.local up -d --build`.

### 19.4 Environment Variables in Docker

`compose.yaml` provides defaults for `DATABASE_URL`, `MAILER_DSN`, `OTP_REDIS_DSN`, and JWT key paths. Store app variables use `STORE_*` prefixed counterparts. Required vars use `${VAR:?required}` which fails fast if missing. Optional vars use `${VAR:-}` which defaults to empty.

## 20. Console Commands

| Command | Module | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `app:identity:user:create` | Identity | Create user: email, username, password, --phone, --role, --admin, --phone-verified |
| `app:storage:qiniu:settings:init` | Storage | Initialize missing Qiniu `common_setting` records (`qiniu.access_key`, `qiniu.secret_key`, `qiniu.bucket`, `qiniu.domain`) without overwriting existing values |
| `app:trade:outbox:publish` | Trade | Relay unpublished Trade integration events to Messenger |
| `app:store:outbox:publish` | Store | Relay Store acceptance/rejection events to Messenger |
| `app:inventory:outbox:publish` | Inventory | Relay published Inventory integration events to Messenger |
| `app:trade:outbox:backfill-correlation` | Trade | Dry-run or `--apply` bounded correlation backfill for unpublished Trade Outbox rows |
| `app:store:outbox:backfill-correlation` | Store | Dry-run or `--apply` bounded correlation backfill for unpublished Store Outbox rows |

## 21. Service Container Wiring

- Default: all `src/` classes autowired/autoconfigured
- Explicit exclusions: `FlatNormalizer`, EventListener classes (except `OpenApiEnricherListener`), Auth/Otp controllers, TokenManager, AliyunSmsProvider, RedisOtpStorage, **Storage concrete drivers**, **WechatService, `src/Wechat/Service/Payment/WechatPayGateway.php`**
- `OpenApiEnricherListener`: registered with `kernel.event_listener` tag on `kernel.response` (priority -10)
- `AccessLogListener`: registered with `kernel.event_listener` tag on `kernel.response` (priority -5)
- `LocaleListener`: registered with `kernel.event_listener` tag on `kernel.request` (priority 20)
- `RestController` subclasses get `RequestStack`, `SerializerInterface`, `TranslatorInterface` via `#[Required]` setter injection
- `PaymentGatewayInterface` implementations auto-tagged `payment.gateway`, collected via `#[AutowireIterator]`
- `PaymentAdjustmentProviderInterface` implementations auto-tagged `payment.adjustment_provider`, collected via `#[AutowireIterator]`
- `MediaStorageInterface` implementations tagged `media.storage`, collected via `#[AutowireIterator]`; `LocalStorage`/`QiniuStorage` are explicitly wired in `src/Storage/Resources/config/services_storage.yaml` because they need scalar/config/repository constructor arguments
- `PriceCalculatorInterface` implementations auto-tagged `trade.price_calculator`, sorted by `getPriority()` — pipeline: BasePriceCalculator(-100) → QuantityCalculator(50) → **TotalAggregator(55)** (establishes subtotal) → **PromotionCalculator(60)** (applies order-level adjustments on the real subtotal)
- `PromotionCalculator` (`App\Promotion\Service\PromotionCalculator`) implements `PriceCalculatorInterface`, tagged `trade.price_calculator` at priority 60, applies promotions after the subtotal is aggregated
- Promotion strategies auto-tagged `promotion.strategy` via `_instanceof` rule, collected by `#[AutowireIterator]` in the strategy registry
- `WechatService` explicitly defined in `services_wechat.yaml` with `%env()` parameter bindings
- `WechatPayGateway` explicitly defined in `services_wechat.yaml` (excluded from global autowiring scan)
- `WalletGateway` autowired in `src/Bridge/PaymentWallet/` via `PaymentGatewayInterface` tag (no explicit exclusion needed)

## 22. Inventory Module — Stock & Reservation System

### 22.1 Overview
The Inventory application (`apps/inventory/src/`) owns materials, per-store stock, Specification recipes, reservations, and the stock ledger. The monolith hosts it through `crud-platform/inventory-app` during transition. It implements the deferred reservation boundary defined in Store.

**Preview safety notice:** Inventory is implemented but is not production-ready.
`INVENTORY_ENABLED` must remain `0` outside isolated development and testing until
fulfillment-driven consumption, safe accepted-order expiry semantics, serialized
confirmation/cancellation, and release-before-reserve handling are implemented and
covered by concurrency tests. The disabled schema/module may be deployed safely.

### 22.2 Domain Model

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Material` | Raw material or finished good. code is unique, immutably frozen upon stock mutation |
| `InventoryStock` | Per-store per-material balance with onHandQuantity, reservedQuantity, allowNegativeStock flag |
| `SpecificationRecipe` | One active recipe per Trade Specification UUID; stores material BOM lines |
| `RecipeLine` | Quantity of a material required per unit of the parent Specification |
| `InventoryReservation` | Idempotent reservation aggregate with status: requested, confirmed, rejected, released, consumed |
| `ReservationLine` | Immutable snapshot of material demand and reserved quantity per reservation |
| `InventoryLedgerEntry` | Append-only audit trail for every stock mutation |
| `InventoryConsumedEvent` | Inbox idempotency record |
| `InventoryOutboxMessage` | Durable integration event relay |

### 22.3 Integration Flow
```
Trade order created
  → Store validates + creates StoreOrder
  → Store publishes inventory.reservation.requested.v1 (if INVENTORY_ENABLED)
  → Inventory resolves recipe or direct finished material
  → Inventory reserves stock atomically (checks allowNegativeStock per stock)
  → Inventory publishes confirmed or rejected outcome
  → Store accepts (confirmed) or rejects (rejected) StoreOrder
  → Store publishes store.order.accepted.v1 or store.order.rejected.v1
  → Trade applies workflow transition
```

### 22.4 Reservation Processing
Recipes expand a Specification into material demand. Material demand is aggregated (same material from multiple specifications merged), then locked in deterministic Material UUID order. Each stock's allowNegativeStock flag controls whether reservation exceeds on-hand quantity. Reservation lines capture immutable material and quantity snapshots.

### 22.5 Compensation & Expiry
- Cancellation triggers release via Store -> Inventory release event
- Expired confirmed reservations are released by `app:inventory:reservations:release-expired` (scheduler)
- Release is idempotent; repeated release of same reservation is no-op

### 22.6 Management APIs
| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST/PUT | `/api/v1/manage/inventory/materials` | ROLE_ADMIN | Material master |
| GET/POST/PUT | `/api/v1/manage/inventory/recipes` | ROLE_ADMIN | Specification recipe |
| GET | `/api/v1/manage/inventory/stocks/{storeUuid}/{materialUuid}` | ROLE_ADMIN | Stock view (virtual zero if absent) |
| POST | `/api/v1/manage/inventory/stocks/{storeUuid}/{materialUuid}/adjust` | ROLE_ADMIN | Stock adjustment |
| PUT | `/api/v1/manage/inventory/stocks/{storeUuid}/{materialUuid}/policy` | ROLE_ADMIN | Toggle allowNegativeStock |

### 22.7 Store Integration Changes
- `TradeOrderCreatedHandler`: when INVENTORY_ENABLED, creates reservationId and writes awaiting_inventory state + reservation request outbox
- New handlers: `InventoryReservationConfirmedHandler`, `InventoryReservationRejectedHandler`, `InventoryReservationReleasedHandler`
- `TradeOrderCancelledHandler`: requests inventory release for cancelled orders with reservation
- `StoreTradeOrderCancellation` tombstone entity: handles out-of-order cancellation events
- Trade events use OrderItem.uuid as stable lineId (not specification UUID)

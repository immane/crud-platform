# Payment Extraction Readiness

> **Payment source has been fully extracted.** This document records the
> completed transition-host work and the remaining runtime cutover steps.

## Completed

- Payment source now lives exclusively in `apps/payment/src` under
  `App\Payment\*` (30 files).
- `apps/payment` has its own Kernel, Composer lock, composer.json (`crud-platform/payment-app`), configuration, PHPUnit smoke test, FrankenPHP image, and MySQL 8.4 service.
- The monolith temporarily loads Payment through the `crud-platform/payment-app` Composer path package; root routes, Doctrine mapping, services, PHPStan, Deptrac, and Rector point to that package.
- The Payment baseline migration owns `payment_invoice`, `payment_outbox_message`, and `payment_payer_directory` — three Payment-owned tables with no foreign keys to non-Payment tables.
- Payment invoices use a Payment-owned `payer_uuid` scalar instead of an ORM association to Identity `users`. The `payment_payer_directory` maps legacy numeric Identity IDs to UUIDs during the transition.
- Payment's `InvoiceService` writes durable outbox rows; the transition host's `app:payment:outbox:publish` publishes paid/failed/cancelled/refunded v1 contracts through the root async transport.
- Trade consumes those contracts via an idempotent `trade_consumed_event` inbox; the synchronous `OrderInvoiceListener` remains temporarily for observation.
- Wallet uses a Core UUID-to-local-ID contract, and WeChat resolves its own user relation by UUID. Payment no longer imports Identity entities or repositories.
- Root Dockerfile copies `apps/payment` before `composer install`, and the root scheduler publishes Payment outbox rows independently.
- The Payment app resolves its own `PayerReferenceResolverInterface` through `PayerDirectoryReferenceResolver` in standalone mode; the monolith binds it to the Identity adapter.
- Payment app includes its own `invoice` workflow state machine.

## Transition Safety

The existing synchronous `OrderInvoiceListener` remains temporarily enabled.
It preserves current API behavior while the durable path is observed. The Trade
Inbox makes the asynchronous copy safe to replay: it records the event ID and
payload hash, treats an identical retry as a no-op, and rejects an event ID
reused with a different payload.

Do not remove the synchronous listener until the following have been observed:

1. Payment Outbox publishing and Trade consumer processing are healthy for a
   bounded production period.
2. Paid, failed, cancelled, partial-refund, and full-refund paths have all been
   exercised through the durable path.
3. Failed transport rows and any in-flight events have been replayed.
4. The resulting eventual-consistency behavior is accepted by the payment and
   order API clients.

## Remaining Extraction Work

1. Introduce the shared broker and schema-versioned serializer required for an
   independent Payment worker and database. Do not route Payment traffic to
   `payment-app` before this is complete: its local Doctrine transport cannot
   deliver lifecycle events to Trade.
2. Disable and remove the synchronous `OrderInvoiceListener` after the durable
   path has met the observation criteria.
3. Add Gateway-issued authentication before exposing protected Payment routes;
   the current standalone security provider is intentionally a placeholder.
4. Move Payment HTTP traffic, worker, and scheduler behind Gateway shadow
   routing, then remove the monolith host assembly.
5. Extract Wallet only after its Payment gateway and adjustment contracts no
   longer expose Payment persistence or framework types.
